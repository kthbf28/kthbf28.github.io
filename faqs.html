										<h2>General Pressure Washing Questions</h2>
											<details>
        										<summary>What is pressure washing, and how is it different from soft washing?</summary>
        											<p>Pressure washing uses high-pressure water to remove dirt, grime, mold, and stains from hard surfaces. Soft washing uses low pressure combined with specialized cleaning solutions and is safer for more delicate surfaces like siding and roofs.</p>
    										</details>

    										<details>
        										<summary>How often should I have my property pressure washed?</summary>
        											<p>Most homes benefit from pressure washing once a year. Properties with heavy shade, moisture, or pollen buildup may require more frequent cleanings.</p>
    										</details>

    										<details>
        										<summary>How long does a pressure washing job take?</summary>
        											<p>Most residential pressure washing jobs take between 1–3 hours, depending on the size of the property and the surfaces being cleaned.</p>
    										</details>

    										<details>
        										<summary>Do I need to be home during the service?</summary>
        											<p>No, as long as we have access to the areas being cleaned and a working water source, you do not need to be present.</p>
    										</details>
